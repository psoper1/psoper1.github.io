## i. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

<sub>The first week so far is about what I expected. With the *Your Path*, it's nice to be able to learn at your own pace rather than try to get everyone on the same page at the same time. This would cause too much confusion and people would feel rushed. Rushed is not something I have felt in this first week so far. The instructors are very knowledgeable and willing to help at any given moment and that has made the process very enjoyable.</sub>

## ii. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

<sub>I'm excited to learn more about Javascript, even though it is very daunting. I'm a creative person so I like the way that Javascript functions and **CAN** function to do really whatever you want it to do.</sub>

## iii. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

<sub>I'm weird because I'm pretty much an open book but also can be very closed off at the same time. After you get to know me you realize that I am very dependable, eager to help and pretty funny! I've messed around with making 2D games in Unity which is really what inspired me to get in to the coding world. Something else about me, I write music. All kinds really, at the moment mainly cinematic scores have been my go to. My personal favorite movie score is from *Interstellar*. I have watched that movie **so** many times and listened to the soundtrack even more. It's just **SO** good. If you are interested, you can find some of my scores [here!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsODJpIV9Zgn72ympqGVT-A)</sub>

## Look at my 2 cats!
