                    <h3>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h3>
                    <p>The first week so far is about what I expected. With the *Your Path*, it's nice to be able to
                        learn at your
                        own pace rather than try to get everyone on the same page at the same time. This would cause too
                        much
                        confusion and people would feel rushed. Rushed is not something I have felt in this first week
                        so far. The
                        instructors are very knowledgeable and willing to help at any given moment and that has made the
                        process
                        very enjoyable.</p>
                    <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
                    <p>I'm excited to learn more about Javascript, even though it is very daunting. I'm a creative
                        person so I like
                        the way that Javascript functions and **CAN** function to do really whatever you want it to do.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h3>
                    <p>I'm weird because I'm pretty much an open book but also can be very closed off at the same time.
                        After you
                        get to know me you realize that I am very dependable, eager to help and pretty funny! I've
                        messed around
                        with making 2D games in Unity which is really what inspired me to get in to the coding world.
                        Something else
                        about me, I write music. All kinds really, at the moment mainly cinematic scores have been my go
                        to. My
                        personal favorite movie score is from *Interstellar*. I have watched that movie **so** many
                        times and
                        listened to the soundtrack even more. It's just **SO** good. If you are interested, you can find
                        some of my
                        scores [here!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsODJpIV9Zgn72ympqGVT-A)</p>

        <div class="card text-white bg-secondary mb-3">
            <div class="row g-0">
                <div class="col">

                    <h3>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of
                        rendering content
                        and
                        providing user experience?</h3>
                    <p>I knew they talked to each-other but didn't realize the extent that could be manipulated. For
                        example, how
                        each
                        tag could be given an ID, then changing how it looks with CSS then manipulating how it reacts
                        via
                        Javascript,
                        and just how many times you can do that. Super interesting and daunting at the same time!</p>
                    <h3>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h3>
                    <p>I think that it is very beneficial and can help you layout your code neatly before you actually
                        do any
                        coding. As I learn more about coding and how to code, I feel like psuedocoding will only get
                        better and more
                        structured.</p>
                    <h3>What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h3>
                    <p>Having that little bit of extra time from when we end for the day and I have to go to work and so
                        far kept me
                        sane. From when we started, I don't get a day off until the end of bootcamp so that my wife and
                        I can
                        survive.
                        Being able to sleep in that extra few minutes and have enough time to eat with her before I go
                        to work
                        (Which is
                        also remote) is very nice.</p>
                    <h3>What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h3>
                    <p>Mostly my cat, Yar. She is a spoiled brat for real. When she's not keeping me awake all night,
                        she's trying
                        to
                        mess with all the cords under my desk all day so I have to kick her out of my office to be able
                        to focus.
                        She
                        does become a distraction at times, however I am able to overcome it. I've had her for about 3
                        years, so I
                        know
                        the tricks of the trade.</p>
                    <h3>How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h3>
                    <p>By reminding myself why I'm doing it. I want to give myself and my wife a better life than we
                        have known.
                        Also,
                        whenever someone calls in asking what I consider a dumb question, reminds me that I don't want
                        to do that
                        for
                        the rest of my life.</p>

                    <h3>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>
                    <p>Jumping straight in to my code without psuedocode. It's important, just hard to get the hang of,
                        however I
                        will.</p>
                    <h3>What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data
                        Structures),
                        Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?</h3>
                    <p>I'd like to learn more about Bootstrap and how it integrates into your work through their CDN's.
                        Knowing what
                        to change and where with the CDN itself being 13000 lines of code.</p>
                    <h3>How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?</h3>
                    <p>That's a hard question to answer, I have not done an in-person sort of Bootcamp and will
                        reference my
                        previous blogpost from Entry 2, question 3.</p>
                    <h3>What is your “Why”?</h3>
                    <p>To give myself and my family a better life, as well as go in to a career where I may be stressed,
                        but a good
                        stressed and not hate my job as I have experienced up until now.</p>

                    <h3>What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?</h3>
                    <p>I learned to be confident in my code and not second guess. As well as not be afraid to break
                        something as it
                        can always be fixed with the right mindset.</p>
                    <h3>What does it mean to develop good code?</h3>
                    <p>You could say good code is code that works, however you can give more to that by saying that it's
                        code that
                        works, yes, but also code that flows well, is readable and easy to come back to for patches or
                        anything of
                        that nature.</p>
                    <h3>What does it mean to be a good developer?</h3>
                    <p>Be confident, trust yourself and A.B.L., Always Be Learning. Technology changes so much from day
                        to day, so
                        to keep an open mind and always be learning are great traits to have as a developer.</p>
                    <h3>What is one thing that programmers hate doing?</h3>
                    <p>I'm going to base this off of what I have learned from class, Carousels and converting pages to
                        PDF's to
                        print. Haha!</p>
